Live Fire Detection Model
Overview
This repository contains a live fire detection model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and executed with OpenCV. The model has been trained to detect the presence of fire in real-time video streams or images.

Key Features
CNN Architecture: The core of this fire detection model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been trained on a dataset of fire and non-fire images. This network is designed to learn and extract relevant features from input frames.

Real-time Detection: The model can process live video feeds or individual frames to identify the presence of fire. This makes it suitable for various applications like fire monitoring systems and safety measures.

OpenCV Integration: OpenCV is used to capture video streams and apply the fire detection model to the frames in real-time. OpenCV provides efficient and powerful tools for computer vision tasks.


Results
Our model has been trained on a diverse dataset and has shown reliable performance in detecting fire in various scenarios. The accuracy and speed of detection make it suitable for real-world applications.
